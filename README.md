How are graceful degradation and service workers related? <br>
When making apps, we can use graceful degredation in our workflow and start with max technology, say, getting all of our data to make the application work properly through requests out to the internet. Using service workers, we can ensure that, at lower levels, our app will still be functional if there are network issues. By using service workers and having data to ensure app functionality, we can address lower levels with grace. <br>
